#### PROJECTS
* **Paragraph Ranking**, Dec 2018 - Jan 2019
Took part in Microsoft AI Challenge 2018 where the task was to rank the 10 candidate paragraphs based on a given
query. For each query there was one paragraph which had the correct answer. Performed basic sentence parsing
and cleaning. I used BM25 initially, getting an MRR score of 0.44. Later tried with different neural net architectures
using CNN, RNN, Attention based models. Finally I used an ensemble of Google BERT models getting an MRR score
of 0.7079 which was ranked 5th in Phase-I.
* **Abnormalities in CT Scans**, Jan 2019 - Feb 2019
Worked on a small image segmentation project where the task was to generate an image highlighting the
abnormality location. Used image augmentation to generate more scenarios followed by U-Net architecture which
is a CNN based encoder-decoder architecture. I was able to achieve loss 0.2483 while dice_loss was 0.0616 with
val_loss 1.4323 and val_dice_loss 0.3556
* **Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis**, Sep 2016 - Oct 2016
Classify product reviews using Machine Learning. The data was collected from Amazon using a crawler. The ratings
were used to label each review making it a multi-class classification problem. The model was trained using different
techniques including Neural Networks, Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression achieving accuracy of more than
80%. Tech stack - Python, Theano
